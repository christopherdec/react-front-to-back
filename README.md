# React Front To Back 2022

[React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022) teached by [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) on Udemy.\
Basically, four projects in increasing complexity.

## 1 - Feedback App

Very simple SPA that has a topic where you can post feedback texts and rating.\
The backend is mocked using the ```json-server``` package, which consumes ```db.json```.

## 2 - Github Finder

A SPA where you can search and view Github users informations, such as profile picture, repositories and followers.\
Uses the Github API to retrieve user data, and Tailwind CSS/daisyui for styling.\

## 3 - House Marketplace

A bit larger web app, developed following the "mobile-first" concept.\
Users can post place offers, which are divided in the rent and sale categories.\
The project uses Firebase for storing files, user data and authentication.\

## 4 - Support Desk

Support ticket system where users can post issues about products by creating a ticket.\
The staff then can answer tickets by adding notes, which the user can respond, going back and forth until the issue is solved and the ticket is closed.\
This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js) and Redux Toolkit for managing state.\
The backend contains simple CRUDs for users, tickets and notes, while also protecting routes with JWT authentication.\
